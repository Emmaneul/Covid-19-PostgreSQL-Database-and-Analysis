-- COVID 19 DATA ANALYSIS PROJECT

-- DATE 27 SEPTEMBER 2021

-- In this SQL script we will go through SQL statements which will generate summaries/views for the main table in the database. 
-- Summarized data can be found under the 'Summaries' folder of this project.

-- TABLE A2 - Figure showing Total Cases, Total Deaths, Case Fatality Rate, Population Infection and Death Rate from Top 20 Countries
-- This table is ordered based on the total_case numbers for each country. Note the differences in case fatality rates and population infection rates.
-- What country characteristics lead to the differences in the way the pandemic affected their respective populations?
-- Notice the conditional clause 'WHERE continent != 0'. Locations where continent = 0 are not recorded as countries.

-- Notice the date conditional formatting below. This had to be included as there was some discrepancies in the data from dates occurring early on in the pandemic.
-- The 'highest_recorded_icu_rate' is calculated by observing the day in which the ration between icu_patients and total_cases was at its maximum.
